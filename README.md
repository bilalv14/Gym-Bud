# Description
The motivation for this app was to help connect not only the average person to a personalized trainer but also make it easy for the gym itself to offer its services to its members. The app will also make it easy for the trainers themselves to connect with their clients 
and offer better training and dietary suggestions to make actual progress with clients further increasing the trainer's reputation and the gym's influx of members. Gym administrators also will have an easier time pairing their trainers with clients because they won't have to advertise their trainers only through flyers or annoying emails that anyone barely reads. What's cool about our app is that although a user can have a trainer and receive suggestions and reminders to eat they can also log their food and workouts if they feel like they have learned enough from their trainer at a certain point or don't want a trainer at all.
